Description:
------------

  Synapse is the smart way to connect and configure docker containers.
  It uses a number of strategies to retrieve configuration and
  discover dependencies such as: environment variables, docker
  standard variables (to come: Kubernetes discovery API, Consul
  discovery API, Consul configuration API, etcd configuration API).

  At its simplest `synapse` takes environment variables and replaces
  them into configuration files, but there is more.  You can create
  your configuration files and put resolvable tags in the place where
  you expect values passed down to the container.  Synapse will then
  replace the tag (or placeholder) with the actual value.

Usage:
------
  synapse [options] file1.cfg.tmpl file2.yml.tmpl fileN.config.tmpl

Options:
--------
  -h        This help screen
  -v        Prints debug information to the stderr

Tag Specifications:
-------------------

  Anatomy of a resolvable tag:

                 target pattern
       resolver       |           delimiter
           |          |           |
        %%docker>>zookeeper.*:2181%%
         |      |              |
  delimiter     |            port
             single or    (optional)
             multiple?


  %%HOME%% %%env>HOME%% %%DATA_DIR%%
  It will look for a matching environment variable,
  when found it will replace the tag with its value.

  %%env>>SERVICE.*%%
  A double angular bracket (`>>`) means that you expect more
  than one result. It will look for environment variables
  like: `$SERVICE1`, `$SERVICE2`, `$SERVICE3` (matching
  `SERVICE.*` regex) and replace the tag with the values
  as a comma-separated list.

  %%docker>zookeeper%%
  It will look for Docker's standard environment variables
  to link the container. For example it in this case it will
  look for: `$ZOOKEEPER_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR`,
  `$ZOOKEEPER_PORT_2181_TCP_PORT` and `$ZOOKEEPER_PORT_2181_TCP`
  The docker resolution is the most commonly used so you can
  omit the `docker` resolver name.

  %%>zookeeper%%
  When the port is not specified it will look for all available
  port names and take the lowest. A service might have more
  than one service port (such as admin port or peers port)
  but typically the client port is the lowest one.

  %%>zookeeper:2181%%
  Otherwise you can specify the port you wish. This will be
  resolved and replaced with the actual container's port.

  %%>>zookeeper.*:2181%%
  If you expect more than one container with a given name
  then you can specify a pattern and add a double angular
  bracket (`>>`). In this case it will look for all zookeeper
  containers and replace the tag with a comma-separated list.


Usage examples:
---------------

  * simple template parsing
  $ synapse /etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf.tmpl

  * if the user can't write the output file
  $ cat /etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf.tmpl | \
      synapse | sudo tee /etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf
