# synapse

Synapse is the smart way to connect and configure docker containers.
It uses a number of strategies to retrieve configuration and discover
dependencies such as: environment variables, docker standard variables
(to come: Kubernetes discovery API, Consul discovery API, Consul
configuration API, etcd configuration API).
