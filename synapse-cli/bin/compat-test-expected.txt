This test  is designed to  verify that the different  platform verison
produce  the same  output  without  having platform-specific  variants
which are unintended.

To follow  a series of  resolvable tags which  will cover most  of the
synapse  features so  that  output  of this  document  can be  checked
against different versions.


(*) Environment variable substituion
  simple-value
  simple-value  (case insensitive match)
  simple-value
  simple-value with pattern matching

(**) Env vars with default values
  default used instead
  default used instead
  %%NO_VALUE%%

(**) Joining multiple env vars
  multiple,env-var,matched
  multiple,env-var,matched
  env-var


(*) Docker enviroment variable linking
  - Single matching container with only one port
    172.17.1.10:24123
    172.17.1.10:24123

  - Single matching container with multiple ports
    172.17.2.10:123
    172.17.2.10:123

  - Single matching container with multiple ports and auto-select port
    172.17.2.10:24123
    172.17.2.10:24123

  - Multiple matching containers with multple ports
    172.17.3.20:9200,172.17.3.30:9200,172.17.3.10:9200

  - Multiple matching containers with multple ports and auto-select port
    172.17.3.20:9100,172.17.3.10:9100,172.17.3.30:9100

  - With default values
    didntmatch:9876
    didntmatch:9876

  - With partial resolution
    172.17.1.10
    24123
    172.17.3.20,172.17.3.30,172.17.3.10

    172.17.3.20;172.17.3.30;172.17.3.10


(*) Unresolved links and vars
  %%DOESNT_EXIST%%
  %%>NOT_FOUND:123%%
  %%[port]>NOT_FOUND:123%%

Now  you should  try  to  resolve this  document  using the  different
platform  specific implementation  and compare  against the  java one.
All version should be the same.
